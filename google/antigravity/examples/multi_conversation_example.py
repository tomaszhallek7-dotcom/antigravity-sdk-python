r"""Exploration of multi-turn and multi-conversation patterns.

Probes the boundaries of LocalConnection lifecycle:

  1. Multi-turn:  Does context carry over between send/receive_steps
     cycles on the same Conversation?

  2. Sequential conversations:  Can we call Conversation.create()
     multiple times on the same strategy, getting independent sessions?

  3. Disconnect:  Does disconnect() cleanly kill the subprocess?

To run:
  python multi_conversation_example.py
